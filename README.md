## Project Description


Hereâ€™s a more polished and concise version of your experience description, highlighting your achievements and the functionalities of the e-commerce app:

I am thrilled to share my experience of developing a comprehensive E-Commerce full stack app dedicated to online transactions of national means. Over a span of three months, my team and I worked diligently to create a seamless and captivating user experience, transforming Figma designs into a functional Flutter UI.

All functionalities and validations are meticulously implemented to provide a reliable and satisfying shopping experience.
